# My solutions: Advent of Code 2025

## Prerequisites:

- Go

## How to use:

Make sure the input for the day is inside the `inputs` folder (check [inputs/README.md](./inputs/README.md)).

Then run `./bin/solve [days]`.

Example:
```bash
# solves day 1
./bin/solve 1

# solves all available and implemented days
./bin/solve

# solves days 1, 3 and 5
./bin/solve 1 3 5
```

The solutions will be available in the folder `outputs`.

## Development

Test:
```bash
go test ./...
```

Build:
```bash
go build --output ./bin/solve
```
